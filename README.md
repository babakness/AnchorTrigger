# AnchorTrigger
AnchorTrigger is a lightweight JavaScript library to trigger a callback whenever the user scrolls past an anchor. A simple use-case is to change active navigation when scrolling a new section into view. 

Its designed to be effecient, for example, callbacks are throttled to 50ms rather than continuous (you can change this).

The library doesn't have any dependencies and is just 1K when gzipped. The source should be pretty straight forward and easy to update. It is written in plain old ES5.

# Usage

A simple use case is

```html
<html>
```
